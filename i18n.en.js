  intro: "We believe coding should be fun, creative, and collaborative. Here’s our manifesto for a better developer experience.",
  manifesto: [
    ["Flow over friction", "Ride the wave, don't fight it."],
    ["Iteration over perfection", "Perfection is obsolete if you can always reroll."],
    ["Augmentation over automation", "AI is a collaborator, not a replacement."],
    ["Product thinking over code crafting", "What matters is what you build, not how you write it."],
    ["Rerolling over debugging", "If fixing takes too long, regenerate."],
    ["Human taste over technical constraints", "The best tech serves great taste, not the other way around."]

  principles: [
    [
      "Focus on the problem, not the code.",
      "Code is just the medium—what matters is solving the right problems."
    ],
    [
      "Taste is the ultimate filter.",
      "AI can generate infinite solutions, but only human judgment can pick the right one."
    ],
    [
      "Systems thinking beats syntax mastery.",
      "The best engineers don't just code—they architect, evaluate, and iterate."
    ],
    [
      "AI is your co-creator.",
      "The best engineers wield AI to amplify their impact, not just automate tasks."
    ],
    [
      "Speed is the new craftsmanship.",
      "The highest priority is delivering valuable software continuously and exponentially faster."
    ],
    [
      "Deliver in minutes, not days.",
      "AI enables a pace where shipping happens as fast as thinking."
    ],
    [
      "Change is fuel.",
      "Welcome new requirements at any stage—flexibility is a superpower, not a burden."
    ],
    [
      "Simplicity scales.",
      "The best way to build fast and flexibly is to maximize what you don't build."
    ],
    [
      "Code is disposable.",
      "If it doesn't work, reroll. Don't get attached."
    ],
    [
      "Favor reinvention over patchwork.",
      "When a solution no longer meets our needs, we embrace regeneration to achieve greater clarity and efficiency."
    ],
    [
      "Optimize for acceleration.",
      "The future belongs to those who build with exponential speed in mind."
    ],
    [
      "Evolve constantly.",
      "Teams should reflect, adapt, and upgrade their tools and workflows regularly."
